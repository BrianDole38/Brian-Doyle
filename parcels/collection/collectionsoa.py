        This function allows to 'insert' a Particle (as object or via its accessor) into this collection. This method
        needs to be specified to each collection individually. Some collections (e.g. unordered list) allow to define
        the index where the object is to be inserted. Some collections can optionally insert an object at a specific
        position - at a significant speed- and memory malus cost (e.g. vectors, arrays, dense matrices). Some
        collections that manage a specified indexing order internally (e.g. ordered lists, sets, trees), and thus
        have no use for an 'index' parameter. For those collections with an internally-enforced order, the function
        mapping equates to:
